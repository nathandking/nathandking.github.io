I am a researcher in geometry processing and physics-based simulation. My research develops robust and efficient numerical methods on complex shapes using closest point queriesâ€”allowing algorithms to work across a wide variety of geometric representations without meshing. For more details, check out my [PhD thesis](assets/pdf/PhD_Thesis.pdf).

I completed my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo, supervised by Christopher Batty and Steven Ruuth. My work has been presented at venues like SIGGRAPH and SIGGRAPH Asia and published in ACM TOG and JCP.  During my PhD, I interned twice at Meta Reality Labs Research. I am currently a Research Scientist at Shapr3D.
