I am a researcher in geometry processing and physics-based simulation. My research develops robust and efficient methods with complex objects using closest point queriesâ€”allowing algorithms to work across a wide variety of geometric representations without meshing. For more details, check out my [PhD thesis](assets/pdf/PhD_Thesis.pdf).

I completed my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo, supervised by [Christopher Batty](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~c2batty/) and [Steve Ruuth](https://steveruuth.org/). Before that, I was a Research Scientist at [Rutter](https://rutter.ca/), earned my MSc in Applied and Computational Mathematics from Simon Fraser University, and my BSc in Applied Mathematics and Physics from Memorial University. During my PhD, I interned twice at Meta Reality Labs Research. My work has been presented at SIGGRAPH and SIGGRAPH Asia and published in ACM TOG and JCP. I am currently a Research Scientist at [Shapr3D](https://www.shapr3d.com/).
